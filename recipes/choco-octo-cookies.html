    <p><h2>Background info</h2></p>
    <p>An old recipe I remember making as a child from a singapore airlines kids member magazine. Basically a sugar cookie with cocoa powder.</p>
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>125g butter, softened</li>
        <li>125g sugar (brown or white)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tbs cocoa powder</li>
        <li>175g flour</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar</li>
        <li>Add egg and cocoa, mix until combined</li>
        <li>Add flour in small amounts while continuing to mix</li>
        <li>Chill dough roughly 30 minutes to make it easy to work with</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 160&deg;C</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 6-8 balls (the rough amount you can make). I recommend working with half of the dough at a time and keeping the other half in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Make a log shape and flatten to about 1cm thickness, make slices half way up cookie and shape into arms</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Cool and decorate as desired, or eat straight up cause you a busy fellow and don't got no time for dat</li>
    </ol></p>
