        <li>1&frac12; cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 sachet or 2&frac12; tsp of dry active yeast</li>
        <li>pinch of sugar</li>

        <li>Check yeast is alive by combining yeast and sugar into warm water.</li>
        <li>You should see a foam layer form to indicate yeast is alive, if not replace yeast.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and and salt into a large bowl and quickly mix.</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients and mix well, dough should be slightly sticky to wet for this bread</li>
        <li>knead well for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Cover with camp cloth and let rise for 1&frac12; hours to 2 hours in warm place. If room is cold, the oven with the bulb on will work well.</li>
        <li>You should expect dough to be puffy, gently fold and rotate onto itself 4-6 times then let rise again for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Line dutch oven with baking paper, fold dough again and tuck underneath to create a ball, then place into dutch oven</li>
        <li>Cover dutch oven with damp cloth and let rise for 20 minutes one final time, in the meantime set oven to 270&degC and place lid inside</li>
        <li>Once 20 minutes has passed,cut lines into top of dough in desired shape, use oven-mitts to place lid ontop and set onto the largest burner on highest setting</li>
        <li>Once dutch oven is hot to touch, place inside oven and bake for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove lid and continue another 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove pot from oven and place loaf on cooling rack</li>
        <li>Let cool for at least 45 minutes before cutting and enjoying!</li>
    </ol>
